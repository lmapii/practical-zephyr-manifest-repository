manifest:
  # lowest version of the manifest file schema that can parse this fileâ€™s data
  version: 0.8

  # `self` defines whatever is only relevant for this manifest file
  # e.g., if we'd like to move the entire repository into a subfolder, we could do this:
  self:
    path: app
  # in fact, if we'd try to initialize the west workspace using the repository as remote,
  # then the `app` folder would have the repository's name. You can override this with the
  # given path option.

  projects:
    # the project name is used as directory name, but considers the given `path-prefix`
    - name: zephyr
      # instead of a tag, `revision` also supports hashes and branches. e.g., `--freeze` will
      # replace all revisions with their aactual commit hashes since tags can always be modified.

      # explicitly adding Zephyr-specific West extensions is only needed in case no `import`s are
      # used - which is almost never the case for Zephyr applications. with `import` in place,
      # the `west.yml` in Zephyr's repository takes care of adding the required West extensions.
